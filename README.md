The main idea of this project is to build production-level, scalable and well-tested project.

Let's focus on what we have now:
###### ✔️ FSD architecture which will allow us build scalable project and make it easily maintainable
###### ✔️ Web app supports multiple languages (i18next) 
###### ✔️ Decomposition of webpack config
###### ✔️ Linters: stylelint, eslint
###### ✔️ Lazy loading 
###### ✔️ HTML5 as a markup for React components
###### ✔️ SCSS for styling + configured css modules 
###### ✔️ Javascript (ES6+) + Typescript for type safe 
###### ✔️ Webpack with loaders and plugins as a bundler for production (highly minified) and development needs
###### ✔️ Bundle minifying in production build
###### ✔️ React router for routing between pages
###### ✔️ Jest and RTL for unit tests
###### ✔️ Responsive
###### ✔️ Easy to implement new theme
